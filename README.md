This project is all about short games in one application, we have integrated 3 amazing games Hand cricket, Matchtrix and Puzznic. You may have played this game but not with computer, so here now you can play it anywhere anytime.

## :cricket_game:**Hand Cricket**
Hand cricket is a game everybody loves to play on their idle time. This game demands no prop but intense hand manipulation and strategies to win. We made this game as traditional as possible there will be a toss for start the game. For playing, you have to choose a number between 1 to 6 and then a number is chosen by the computer. In case, both choose a different number then score of the player batting is equal to the number chosen by him. The total score keeps on adding until both come up with the same number. After that, batsman will out. To win you have to score more than the computer scored if you are the bowler in first innings and if not then you have to out the computer before it reaches to target and that’s it, so now give it a try and score runs.

## :boom:**Matchtrix**
Matchtrix is a game where you have to pick matchsticks minimum 1 to maximum 4 turn by turn from the pile of 21 matchsticks and the one who picks the last one loses the game. Simple isn’t it?
